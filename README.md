## Description
This program is supposed to simulate a pizza ordering service. A user is supposed to give an order that includes a certain number of pizzas. The user can select what type of toppings they want on the pizza and how they would like it cooked. At the end, the user can checkout and the program will return the price of their order. This program utilizes the factory creation pattern to create new pizzas and add them to the user's order. 

## How To Run
To Run this program just copy the git repository into your eclipse IDE and go into the Main file. From there you can create an instance of a PizzaOrder where you can order pizza using any of the methods provided in the PizzaOrder class.

   - prints all the user's pizzas in their cart.
- `public AbstractPizza getPizzaByOrderID(int orderID)`
  - returns a specific pizza in the user's cart.
- `public boolean addPizzaToCart(PizzaType pizzaType)`
  - adds a pizza to the user's cart. Returns true if the pizza was successfully added to the cart, otherwise the method returns false.
